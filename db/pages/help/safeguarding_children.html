<p>
  We take the safety of children online very seriously. [[name|community]] has
  taken several measures to ensure this site is never utilized in a manner
  that is harmful to anyone, especially children. This page is here to tell
  you what we've done, and to inform you of your options for further
  and greater protection of your children online.

<p class="highlight">
  I've already read this and the <a href="/pages/help/privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
  Just let me <a href="/privacy?consent=true">authorize my children</a>.
</p>

<h2>Site Access</h2>

<p>
  Only members and regular attenders of [[name|community]] are given access
  to this site. In order to gain access, church-goers must demonstrate a
  certain level of commitment to the church and to attending regularly.
  All visitors to the church must have had some contact with church staff
  before they are considered a regular attender and allowed to sign in.
</p>

<h3>Children Under Age 13</h3>
<p>
  By default, no one under the age of 13 may sign into this site, nor is
  their information available anywhere on the site for other Users.
  You may, however, choose to display information about your children
  and allow them to sign in via the
  <a href="/privacy">Privacy</a>
  page. Please read our <a href="/pages/help/privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>
  for more information.
</p>

<h2>Messages</h2>

<p>
  You have control over what can and cannot be done regarding
  messages from this site. If you wish to disable private messages
  altogether, you may do so by going to your <a href="/privacy">Privacy</a>
  page and unchecking the box labeled "Private Messages Enabled." Also,
  by default, every email address is hidden from others.
  This prevents people from sending you or your children email
  messages directly. Instant Messaging IDs are not allowed
  on profiles, either; this further protects children from being
  contacted without your knowledge.
</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
  Please read our Privacy Policy located <a href="/pages/help/privacy_policy">here</a>
  in order to better understand how we use personal information collected
  on this web site and at the church.
