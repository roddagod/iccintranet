### Development Setup Using Vagrant

If you're a developer and want to get everything running locally, this is the easiest way.

Operating System: Windows, Mac, or Linux

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). It's free and it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
1. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) on your host machine.
1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
   * If you're on Mac, you can use [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/).
   * If you're on Windows, you can use [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/).
1. Clone the repository to your host machine: `git clone git://github.com/churchio/onebody.git` (If you forked the project, clone from your own fork.)
1. In your terminal, change to the project directory: `cd onebody`
1. Run vagrant: `vagrant up`

Now visit the site running in development mode at http://localhost:8080.

You can use your favorite text editor to make changes inside the `onebody` directory. Changes should show in your browser after refreshing.

Check out [Using Vagrant](https://github.com/churchio/onebody/wiki/Using-Vagrant) on the wiki for further help and tips.

1. Install MySQL.
1. Install Git.
1. Install ImageMagick.
1. Install Node.js.
1. `git clone git://github.com/churchio/onebody.git && cd onebody`
1. `mysql -uroot -e "grant all on onebody_dev.* to onebody@localhost identified by 'onebody';"`
1. `mysql -uroot -e "grant all on onebody_test.* to onebody@localhost identified by 'onebody';"`
1. `cp config/database.yml{.mysql-example,}`
1. `gem install bundler`

1. `cp config/secrets.yml{.example,} && vim config/secrets.yml` and add a random secret token to both the "development" and "test" sections (you can use `rake secret` to generate a new random secret).
1. `rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed`
1. `rails server`

Now visit the site running in development mode at http://localhost:3000.

1. `mysql -uroot -pROOT_PASSWORD -e "grant all on onebody_test.* to onebody@localhost identified by 'onebody';"`
1. `cp config/database.yml{.mysql-example,}`
1. `gem install bundler`
