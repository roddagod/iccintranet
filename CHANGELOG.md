# Change Log

This is not meant to be a detailed account of everything changed in each release,
but will give a general idea of what to expect. Also included are instructions for upgrading from previous versions.

For general upgrade instructions, see the wiki
[here](https://github.com/churchio/onebody/wiki/Manual-Installation#how-to-upgrade).
Any release-specific upgrade notes below should be applied *after* the general instructions in the wiki
(unless otherwise noted).

## 3.8.0 (Unreleased)

### Upgrade Notes

1.  OneBody now looks for the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to determine if the connection is secure.
    Your existing nginx config will need `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;` added.

2.  The default nginx config now sets `client_max_body_size 80m;` to match increased document sizes of 75mb.

Make both of these changes to your nginx config (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/onebody`) so that it looks like this:

```
upstream onebody {
    # -snip-
}

server {
    listen 80;
    client_max_body_size 80m;                                     # <---- change this line to 80m

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://onebody;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;               # <---- add this line
    }
}
```

Be sure to restart nginx with `systemctl restart nginx`


### Changes

* Chore: Increase max file size for documents and attachments from 25mb to 75mb
* Chore: Increase request body size in nginx config
* Chore: Make database text columns for messages bigger

## 3.7.0 (2017-03-07)

### Upgrade Notes

1.  The encoding used for string/text columns in the database has changed. The migration to update the encoding
    can take quite awhile, especially if you have a lot of data in your database. Also be sure to **make a
    backup of your database** (see https://github.com/churchio/onebody/wiki/Backups for help).

2.  Imports were not being properly scoped by site id before, and now they are. You will need to manually fix any
    imports to point to the proper site. For most people, the following should work:

    ```
    onebody console # or rails console
    [1] pry(main)> Import.unscoped.update_all('site_id = 1')
      SQL (0.7ms)  UPDATE `imports` SET site_id = 1
    => 23
    [2] pry(main)> exit
    ```
